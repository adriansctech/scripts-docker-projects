# scriptsdockerprojects
## How to use 
Only for version 5.6 of php
This script will clone the DOCKER-LAMP repository the Carlos Reig (https://github.com/carlosreig/docker-lamp), as a base system and then it will ask us for the url of the project that we want to have inside our docker. It is automated to clone, the repository we want in the correct folder. The script will end leaving the mysql console open, to create the database.
